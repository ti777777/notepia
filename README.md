    image: redis:7-alpine
    container_name: notepia-redis
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - redis_data:/data
    command: redis-server --appendonly yes
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "redis-cli", "ping"]

    environment:
      PORT: 8080
      APP_SECRET: change-me-to-a-secure-random-string
